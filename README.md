abc-music-gen uses an [LSTM RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) to learn music in [ABC notation](http://abcnotation.com/blog/2010/01/31/how-to-understand-abc-the-basics/) and to generate its own music. We are training on a collection of Canadian folk music collected from [JC's ABC Tune Finder](http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/cgi/abc/tunefind), [Traditional Tune Archive](https://tunearch.org/wiki/TTA), and the [Montreal Session Tunebook](https://www.montrealsession.ca/listing.php?title=Quebec&book=quebec.abc), though this code can be used with any music represented in ABC notation. ABC can be generated in any desired length, though more than one song may be included in the generated text.

The produced LSTM model is evaluated on the basis of how well it can predict the next character in a song (from a validation set), given a seed comprised of a songs's metadata (which can include title, key, time signature, etc) and the first few bars of the song itself.

This notebook requires the following python libraries:
- google.colab
- matplotlib
- numpy
- os
- tensorflow
- tqdm

To run the code, make sure your ABC songs are stored in Google Drive. Mount your Google Drive to Colab by running the top code cell and authenticating. Adjust the filepath `mypath` to match the location of your songs. You can now sequentially execute the rest of the code cells.

Generated songs can be copied into an ABC-to-MIDI converter, like https://colinhume.com/Music.aspx, to produce audio files and sheet music.
